            <p>I chose the name Crowdly Media because it is the name of my creative marketing agency that I just started and I want to bring it to life in a sense through this and practice for my actual agency site. The name represents the fact that we help companies and businesses reach and target their right crowd. The domain name is crowdlymedia.co.za.</p>
